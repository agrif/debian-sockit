The official distribution includes:
 * debian.img.bz2
 * readme.pdf
 * sdcard.pdf
 * example.zip
 * extras.zip

The official SD card image is created by essentially following the guide,
except:

 * the u-boot.txt file is used (compiled) as u-boot.scr
 * the boot backup directory
 * there is a README.txt in the boot partition, describing it:
   * what version of debian
   * what board
   * date it was created
   * my name and email
   * default username and password
   * uart baud rate
   * using socfpga.rbf
 * the timezone is UDT,
 * the username is 'arrow' and the password is 'sockit'

Then, on an actual board... (so that dkms doesn't explode)
 * instead of installing debs manually, they are installed from
     deb https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/debian-sockit/repo ./
   inside /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-sockit.list
 * install apt-transport-https and then `apt-get update`
 * installed: kernel and sampler-player modules, see below

The repository is filled with:
 * sampler-player: built with `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b`
 * linux kernel, built as in sd card guide

The repo itself is rebuilt with a Makefile, contained here in `repo/`.
